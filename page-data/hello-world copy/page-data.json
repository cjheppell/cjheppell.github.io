So expect the styling to change\nan awful lot.</p>\n<h3>Technical details</h3>\n<p>It also felt like a good opportunity to try out <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a>\nto generate this static website. I’d previously tried to use <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>\nand <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, but found them both pretty difficult to get started with.</p>\n<p>Gatsby, on the other hand, is just standard React (with a bit of\nGraphQL on the side). Since I’m familiar with ReactJS from my job,\nit was much easier to get started.</p>\n<p>I’m also using <a href=\"https://react.semantic-ui.com/\">React Semantic UI</a> for\nthe various React components on this site.</p>\n<h3>Hosting</h3>\n<p>I’m hosting this website on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub pages</a>, fronted by a custom domain provided by <a href=\"https://www.tsohost.com/\">TSOHost</a>.</p>\n<h3>Wrap-up</h3>\n<p>That’s all for now. This is the first time I’ve actually followed through with getting a\npersonal website actually up and running. I’ve written the code a bunch of times in\nthe past in private GitHub repos, but never got around to getting them hosted.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I’ll keep the momentum going!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World","date":"December 01, 2019","description":"Obligatory 'my first blog post!' including the technical details of how I actually built and host this website."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world copy/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World"}}}}}
